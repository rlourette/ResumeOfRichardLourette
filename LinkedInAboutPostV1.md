🚀 Excited to share my recent achievements in Aerospace Consulting! 🛰️

I developed a high-reliability, high-availability spacecraft constellation payload design that met all the prime contractor requirements. The Space VPX concept included science data payload processing and solid-state storage solution, using reconfigurable FPGA computing to handle multi-giga samples-per-second science data.

The design featured five (5) rad-hard MCUs, interconnected with SpaceWire to control the payload. The processor design includes and integrated radiation-tolerant multi-terabyte solid-state recorder, FPGA processing, space-grade MCUs, and space-rated DDR4 and MRAMs.

I also led the development of the networked software architecture, building upon NASA's Core Flight System (cFS) framework on RTEMs real-time operating system processor nodes.

Additionally, I authored the technical volume of the proposal, securing an eight $(8) figure constellation business deal with the prime contractor.

Throughout my career, I've generated significant business value for various companies, both startups and blue-chip, by aligning research activities with business objectives across different timeframes. As a hands-on technical leader, I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of aerospace technology.
