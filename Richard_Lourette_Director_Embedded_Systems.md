## LEADERSHIP PHILOSOPHY

"I believe technical leaders must be able to work through problems at any level to effectively guide their teams and make data-driven decisions. I challenge my staff but won't let them fail - when team members encounter complex challenges, I guide them with questions that help them discover solutions while building their technical confidence."

This hands-on approach has consistently helped me build high-performing teams that value both technical excellence and collaborative problem-solving.
