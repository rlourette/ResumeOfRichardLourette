Dear [Recipient's Name],

Our company was presented with an opportunity from a large aerospace company to design and provide a very complex and extremely high performance image processing system for a space satellite platform. At the time we did not have the right person available to architect and run this type of project, so when we considered external resources, Rich's name went straight to the top of the list. Based on his deep experience set as an SME in all the necessary competencies, bringing him onto the project lent us immediate credibility with the customer and was key in landing several contracts to architect, and then design the required subsystems.

I highly recommend Rich Lourette for inclusion on any challenging design effort as he will not only bring his expertise, but also real passion and enthusiasm for creating the best possible solution to any problem. Having had the privilege of working closely with Rich for nearly two years, I was present to hear the customer praise him for his novel approaches and uniquely powerful solutions to complex problems. The architectures he composed were not just directly applicable in form, they were backed up with very detailed documentation to masterfully communicate with the customer teams.

On top of his valuable skill set, Rich is also one of the most enjoyable people to have on a collaborative effort. Energetic yet easy going, what could have become overly stressful scenarios were instead controlled, and always progressed at a good pace. Approachable and respectful to other's input, he helps to bring out the best possible work from his teammates.

I look forward to my next opportunity to bring Rich onto a project, and am very confident he would be a valuable asset on any design team.

Sincerely,  
Matt McNulty

### Chuck Moon
**Engineering Consulting**  
April 7, 2025, Chuck worked with Richard on the same team

I first met Rich in 2003 when we both began our careers in aerospace at Kodak C&G. I was an electrical supervisor, and he was a principal investigator. He quickly earned a reputation for diving into complex imaging problems and emerging with practical, innovative solutions. Rich played a key role in pioneering Gorgon Stare, a video capture technology developed for the Air Force. This system, designed for wide-area surveillance, uses a spherical array of nine cameras attached to an aerial drone to capture and transmit video feeds, providing persistent, 24-hour coverage of large areas.

In 2022, our careers intersected once again when D3 Engineering selected Rich to lead our effort in developing a space imaging system for an L3-Harris customer. After presenting an innovative architecture, D3 was awarded the contract. A couple of months later, the customer requested a fixed-price rebid. Rich once again led the effort, and by making some architectural changes, we were able to meet our target cost and schedule. Unfortunately, the ultimate customer then went dark.

I offer my personal endorsement for Rich without any reservations. I hold his engineering leadership skills in the highest regard.
