**Providing Embedded Systems Architecture and Advanced Imaging Solutions for mission-critical and cutting-edge technology projects.**

Specializing in FPGA-based imaging systems, Time-of-Flight camera architectures, and real-time 3D vision processing. Expert in architecting complete embedded solutions from bare-metal to Linux platforms, with particular focus on hardware-software integration for aerospace, medical devices, and industrial IoT applications.

My 30+ years of experience spans the entire embedded systems spectrum - from spacecraft payload processors to consumer electronics that shipped in millions of units. Currently architecting advanced ToF camera systems with 90 fps real-time 3D imaging capabilities, USB3 Vision protocol implementations, and FPGA-accelerated distance calculation algorithms. Deep expertise in Xilinx/AMD platforms including Kria K26 SoM, Versal architectures, and Pynq framework integration.

System architecture is both an art and a science - requiring not just technical depth, but the ability to see how each component contributes to system performance, reliability, and scalability. My clients engage me because they need someone who understands the complete technology stack: from VCSEL optical subsystems and differential I/O interfaces to CPython control architectures with asyncio-based operation. I ensure robust, production-ready solutions by focusing on what matters most: clean architecture, comprehensive documentation, and designs that scale from proof-of-concept to mass production.

My approach combines hands-on technical expertise with strategic platform thinking. As a consultant, I deliver not just solutions, but enable knowledge transfer through detailed Interface Control Documents, system architecture specifications, and technical documentation that empowers teams to own and evolve the technology. This commitment to transparent, well-documented engineering has been a hallmark of my career - from leading international firmware teams at Kodak to architecting radiation-hardened systems at L3Harris.

**A strategic advantage for complex projects:** Early architectural decisions determine 80% of system capabilities and constraints. Bringing in experienced system architecture expertise at project inception identifies physical limits, mitigates risks, and uncovers innovation opportunities before they become expensive course corrections.

Through RL Tech Solutions LLC, I provide consulting at $125/hour for embedded systems architecture, FPGA-based imaging systems, and technical leadership. I'm particularly interested in projects involving heterogeneous computing (CPU+FPGA), real-time vision processing, autonomous systems, or any application pushing the boundaries of what's possible with embedded technology.

**Current areas of focus:** ToF/3D imaging systems, FPGA acceleration for edge AI, safety-critical embedded architectures, and modern C++ applications for resource-constrained environments.

Let's discuss how my experience can accelerate your next breakthrough product.
