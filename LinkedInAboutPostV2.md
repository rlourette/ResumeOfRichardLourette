**Providing Embedded Systems Architecture and Advanced Imaging Solutions for mission-critical technology projects.**

Specializing in FPGA-based imaging systems, Time-of-Flight camera architectures, and real-time 3D vision processing. Expert in complete embedded solutions from bare-metal to Linux, with focus on hardware-software integration for aerospace, medical devices, and industrial IoT.

30+ years spanning spacecraft payload processors to high-volume consumer electronics. Currently architecting advanced ToF camera systems with real-time 3D imaging, USB3 Vision protocols, and FPGA-accelerated distance algorithms. Deep expertise in Xilinx/AMD platforms including Kria K26 SoM, Versal architectures, and Pynq framework.

My clients need someone who understands the complete technology stack: from VCSEL optical subsystems to CPython control architectures with asyncio operation. I deliver robust, production-ready solutions through clean architecture, comprehensive documentation, and designs that scale from proof-of-concept to mass production.

Beyond solutions, I enable knowledge transfer through detailed ICDs and architecture specifications that empower teams to own and evolve the technology. This commitment to transparent engineering extends from leading international teams at Kodak to architecting radiation-hardened systems at L3Harris.

**Strategic advantage:** Early architectural decisions determine 80% of system capabilities. Bringing experienced expertise at project inception identifies limits, mitigates risks, and uncovers opportunities before expensive course corrections.

• 20 US Patents in embedded systems, signal processing, imaging
• Algorithms deployed in many devices 
• Previously held DoD Top Secret clearance (available for reinstatement)
• Published technical content on modern C++ for safety-critical systems

Through RL Tech Solutions LLC, I provide high value consulting for embedded systems architecture, FPGA-based imaging, and technical leadership. Particularly interested in heterogeneous computing (CPU+FPGA), real-time vision, autonomous systems, or applications pushing embedded technology boundaries.

**Current focus:** ToF/3D imaging, FPGA acceleration for edge AI, safety-critical architectures, modern C++ for resource-constrained environments.

Let's discuss how my experience can accelerate your next breakthrough product.
